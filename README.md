# HOW-TOs
This repo contains short "how-to" code blocks/snippets that can be reused in various programs. Partly for self-note/future reuse and partly to give some algorithmic to beginner programmers. Some notes incorporates details from various resources (books, online platforms) where I include my own implementation and proper citation of the resources used/consulted.
